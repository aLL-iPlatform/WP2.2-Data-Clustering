# WP2.2-Data-Clustering
Unclassified, unsupervised data classification at cloud cluster


The libraries that you will need to execute on a data cluster are TensorFlow, NumPy and any other libraries that you may need for your specific project

 Here is a Python program to be executed in TensorFlow to apply data analytics on a dataset at a cluster called aLL-i Net, designed, developed, updated, and trained on unclassified and unsupervised data:

# Import the necessary libraries
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Load the dataset aLL-i from the cluster
data = np.load('aLL-i.npy')

# Create a neural network model using TensorFlow
model = tf.keras.models.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='relu', input_shape=(data.shape[1],)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu'),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])

# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss='binary_crossentropy',
              metrics=['accuracy'])

# Fit the model to the dataset
model.fit(data, epochs=10

please continue

# Evaluate the performance of the model
test_loss, test_acc = model.evaluate(data)

print('Test accuracy:', test_acc)

# Apply data analytics on the dataset
predictions = model.predict(data)

# Print the results
print('Data analytics applied successfully!')
print('Predictions:', predictions)
